# Sorting-Algorithm

📌 Overview

Welcome to my Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! In this project, I explore and visualize five different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort. The visualizations help demonstrate how each sorting technique works by dynamically updating a bar chart as sorting progresses.
Through real-time animations, I showcase how numbers are rearranged step by step. This tool makes sorting algorithms more intuitive and interactive, helping me and others understand their functionality and efficiency better.

🚀 Features

I have implemented multiple sorting algorithms in Python, each paired with a real-time visualization using Matplotlib. This project allows me to witness sorting in action and compare different techniques. Whether you're a beginner learning sorting or an experienced programmer analyzing efficiency, this project offers valuable insights.

•	Implementation of multiple sorting algorithms
•	Real-time visualization with Matplotlib
•	Step-by-step sorting animations
•	Comparison of different sorting methods

🛠️ Technologies Used

I built this project using Python, with Matplotlib handling all the visualizations. No complex dependencies are required, making it easy to set up and run.

📊 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

🔹 Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

🔹 Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds a sorted array one element at a time by placing each element in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the list.

🔹 Counting Sort

Counting Sort is a non-comparative algorithm that determines the position of each element by counting occurrences and placing elements accordingly. It is most effective for a limited range of integers.

🔹 Radix Sort

Radix Sort sorts numbers by processing individual digits from the least significant to the most significant. It relies on Counting Sort as a subroutine to handle digit placement.

🔹 Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort distributes elements into different buckets based on their values. Each bucket is then sorted individually, and the sorted elements are merged back together.

🎥 Sorting Visualizations

I have created real-time bar chart updates to visualize each sorting algorithm in action. The visualizer provides dynamic feedback as numbers are rearranged step by step.
